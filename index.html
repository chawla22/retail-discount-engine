    <h1>Welcome to Retail Discount Engine Web Page</h1>
    <p>In this challenge, youâ€™ll build a basic retail discount engine using JavaScript conditionals and loops. This tool will simulate pricing decisions based on customer types, product inventory levels, and promotional categories.
You will practice decision-making using if, else if, and switch statements, then use loops to cycle through customer orders and inventory updates. The engine must evaluate multiple pricing rules and apply dynamic business logic across an inventory dataset.
